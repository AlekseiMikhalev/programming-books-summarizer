# Programming Books Summarizer

This project was born as a result of my routine learning process. I have a lot of cool programming books which I eager to read, but I faced the following problems:

1. Lack of time for reading
2. Forgetting some information that I already read from books due to lack of structured notes

The main purpose of reading tech books for me is absorbing useful practices, technologies and ability to apply them on practice. Therefore, I decided to create a tool that help me to learn more, within shorter time period, and save knowledge in a useful structred way.
